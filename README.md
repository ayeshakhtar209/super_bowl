# TV, Halftime Shows, and the Big Game

In this project, I found out how some of the elements of the Super Bowl interact with each other and answered questions like:

- What are the most extreme game outcomes?
- How does the game affect television viewership?
- How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?
- Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?

This project gave me an opportunity to apply the skills from Intermediate Python for Data Science (Cleaning & Importing, Manipulation, Visualization).

The dataset used in this project was scraped and polished from Wikipedia. It is made up of three CSV files, one with game data, one with TV data, and one with halftime musician data for all 52 Super Bowls through 2018.
